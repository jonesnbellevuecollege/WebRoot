<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_keyboardshortcuts.asp">W3schools - All Main Keyboard Shortcuts.</a><br />
While simple, the fundamentals of navigation and accessability are always important.<br />
This resource is useful for not only web developent and programming, but for everyday computer usage as well and features
keyboard shortcuts for both Windows and Mac users. Those who may need a refresher on certain software and OS shortcuts, or are perhaps looking to improve
their knowledge and effifiency when navigating their desktop environment will find a treasure trove of information here - I myself learned many new shortcuts here.
Those with disabilities who depend on navigating their computer and computer software will also find a great volumne of useful things here for imrpoved usage.<br />

<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a><br />
A classic "watering hole" for developers of all skill levels to ask questions peer-to-peer, share development resources, and help resolve issues they face with programming projects.<br />
Stack Overflow is a large community-driven resource for developers from every corner of the stack to come together and figure stuff out. It is an informal forum to ask questions where other
programmers would answer and offer advice and help troubleshoot issues they are facing. Stack Overflow now also features a few other useful resrouces such as an offering of their own generative
AI tools that can be integrated with into other apps and - in a new collaboration with Indeed - a pretty comprehensive job board aimed at those in the field of programming and adjacent techonology-focused
roles. A little light on offerings and less bustling than in previous years, but still a great and empowering resource.<br />

  <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a><br />
  <b>A Full Stack web development program with a full curriculum greater than most any paid full stack bootcamp... completely free!</b><br />
  The Odin Project is a full stack development program designed to take developers from all skill levels - including (and especially) beginners - and instill in them the basic fundamentals of web development and take
  them on a journey all the way to job-ready developers. The program is open-source (and therefore completely free) and extremely comprehensive, with beginning-to-end taking a couple years on average
  (depending on the pace that you set for yourself). Lauded by beginners and mid=level engineers for it's approachability and great knowledge offerings, and praised by senior developers for it's accurately simulated real-word development
  environment to get people job-ready, The Odin Project is no slouch and has as much to offer as a bootcamp but without the pricetag. In addition to their resources for all things web-development related,
  they also feature a "Foundations" learning path to cover all the basics followed by a split into two core learning paths; a full stack JavaScript path and a full stack Ruby on Rails path, which gives budding developers the
  opportunity to shape their curriculum around their needs or goals.<br />
