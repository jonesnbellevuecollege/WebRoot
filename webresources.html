<h4><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_keyboardshortcuts.asp">W3schools - All Main Keyboard Shortcuts.</a></h3>
<b>Keeping the fundamentals close-at-hand. A large collection of the essential navigation and functionality shortcuts for both Windows and Mac help to improve efficiency and make "accessability" more accessible to all.</b><br />
This resource is useful for not only web developent and programming, but for everyday computer usage as well and features
keyboard shortcuts for both Windows and Mac users. Those who may need a refresher on certain software and OS shortcuts, or are perhaps looking to improve
their knowledge and effifiency when navigating their desktop environment will find a treasure trove of information here - I myself learned many new shortcuts here.
Those with disabilities who depend on navigating their computer and computer software will also find a great volumne of useful things here for imrpoved usage.<br />

<h4><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">MDN (Mozilla Developer Network)</a></h4>
<b>A large collection of documentation and curriculum-type resources for developers of all walks and stages, with a large offering of learning tools.</b>
MDN offers a bounty of reference documentation, up-to-date development trend information in their blog, development tools such as website scanning (as a security compliance validation tool) and AI-powered assistance, on top
having one of the most handy, beginner-friendly, module-based, guides to learning and honing key web development skills; their learning area. In this learning area in particular they have curriculum specific to many kinds of 
development purposes, one of the most pertinent to our role being their <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development">Learn Web Development</a> course, which walks you through everything from
environment-setup to frameworks for web development, performance optimization, and much more. In their modules also offer practice exercises, provide documentation, tutorials, links to other learning resources for adjacent skills,
and code examples on Git.

<h4><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a></h4>
<b>A classic user-driven forum for developers of all skill levels to ask questions peer-to-peer, share development resources, and help resolve issues they face with programming projects.</b><br />
Stack Overflow is a large community-driven resource for developers from every corner of the stack to come together and figure stuff out. It is an informal forum to ask questions where other
programmers would answer and offer advice and help troubleshoot issues they are facing. Stack Overflow now also features a few other useful resrouces such as an offering of their own generative
AI tools that can be integrated with into other apps and - in a new collaboration with Indeed - a pretty comprehensive job board aimed at those in the field of programming and adjacent techonology-focused
roles. A little light on offerings and less bustling than in previous years, but still a great and empowering resource.<br />

  <h4><a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a></h4>
  <b>A Full Stack web development program with a full curriculum greater than most any paid full stack bootcamp... completely free!</b><br />
  The Odin Project is a full stack development program designed to take developers from all skill levels - including (and especially) beginners - and instill in them the basic fundamentals of web development and take
  them on a journey all the way to job-ready developers. The program is open-source (and therefore completely free) and extremely comprehensive, with beginning-to-end taking a couple years on average
  (depending on the pace that you set for yourself). Lauded by beginners and mid=level engineers for it's approachability and great knowledge offerings, and praised by senior developers for it's accurately simulated real-word development
  environment to get people job-ready, The Odin Project is no slouch and has as much to offer as a bootcamp but without the pricetag. In addition to their resources for all things web-development related,
  they also feature a "Foundations" learning path to cover all the basics followed by a split into two core learning paths; a full stack JavaScript path and a full stack Ruby on Rails path, which gives budding developers the
  opportunity to shape their curriculum around their needs or goals.<br />

    <h4><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freeCodeCamp</a></h4>
    <b>A variety of full-bodied curriculums covering every aspect of development one might need and more.</b><br />
    freeCodeCamp is a large collection of tutorials on everything programming, featuring articles, guides, and video resources on everything under the sun when it comes to development and - like The Odin Project - it's completely free.
    In addition to the free courses offered on their website, they also have a fantastically wide selection of in-depth tutorials on everything from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@freecodecamp">their YouTube channel</a> covering everything from
    introduction tutorials on using Git and Github all the way to building advanced AI/ML projects, freeCodeCamp is a one-stop-shop for highly granular (but approachable) tutorials and guides that have helped me to learn a lot in the realm of development.
    In addition to all of their free courses, and numerous video tutorials on YouTube, they also offer an extensive volume of industry-recognized certifications that can help with targeted skills development and increase job opportunities.<br />
